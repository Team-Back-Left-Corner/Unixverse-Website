<h2>Starting up:</h2>
<p>Emacs is a powerful text editor that is commonly used on Unix-based 
systems. To launch Emacs, simply enter the command "emacs" in your terminal. 
If Emacs is not installed on your system, you can typically install it using 
your package manager. 
</p>
<h2>Editing Files:</h2>
<p>To open a file in Emacs, press "Ctrl-x Ctrl-f" and type the path to the 
file you want to edit. Once you have opened a file, you can start editing 
it immediately. To move the cursor around the file, use the arrow keys or 
the "Ctrl-f," "Ctrl-b," "Ctrl-n," and "Ctrl-p" commands. To insert text at 
the cursor, simply start typing. You can also use the "Backspace" and 
"Delete" keys to delete characters.
</p>
<h2>Searching and replacing:</h2>
<p>To search for text in Emacs, press "Ctrl-s" and enter the search term. 
Emacs will highlight the first occurrence of the search term and move 
the cursor to it. To find the next occurrence of the search term, press 
"Ctrl-s" again. To replace text in Emacs, press "Alt-%" and enter the 
search term and the replacement text. Emacs will prompt you to confirm 
each replacement before making the change.
</p>
<h2>Saving and Exiting:</h2>
<p>To save your changes and exit Emacs, press "Ctrl-x Ctrl-s" to save the 
file, and then press "Ctrl-x Ctrl-c" to exit Emacs. If you have unsaved 
changes, Emacs will prompt you to save them before exiting. You can also 
use the "Ctrl-x Ctrl-w" command to save the file under a different name.
